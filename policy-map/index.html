    <h1>Greener Corridors for a More Resilient City</body</h1>
    <h2>Issues & Opportunities</h2><p></p>
    <p class="p-header">
      <a href="https://www.mas.org/initiatives/greener-corridors/" target="_blank">Greener Corridors</a> examines New York City’s largest arterial thoroughfares as an opportunity to create more livable, efficient, and green public spaces. As a mix of urban street (where people live and shop) and road (designed to quickly move large volumes of through-traffic), such corridors are sometimes referred to as “<a href="https://www.planetizen.com/news/2024/05/129032-stroads-worst-both-worlds" target="_blank">stroads</a>” in urban planning circles. This street-road mix is often incompatible, and stroads are frequently criticized for being inefficient, unappealing, dangerous, and too focused on through-movement at the expense of walkable environments that foster a sense of place. <b>This page, which follows the research presented in Parts 1 and 2 (linked below), catalogs legislation, policies, plans, and visions related to the improvement of New York City's arterial roads.</b></p><br>

      <p class="p-narrow">New York City is fortunate to have a growing number of governmental, nonprofit, and community advocates who recognize the issues that are exacerbated by arterials and are beginning to rethink them in the face of climate change, shifting mobility preferences, and ever-evolving local needs. While programs and ideas for improving arterials run the gamut from street design standards to freight efficiency, New York City lacks a comprehensive approach to arterial redesign that leverages the arterial right-of-way as an asset and is scaled for greater impact.</p>
      <p class="p-narrow">There is still a shortage of funding and overall political will. However, by understanding the policy landscape of improved street safety, broader mobility options, and innovative resiliency measures, there is an opportunity to consider how a reimagined network of arterial roads can have the most impact. The following interactive diagram inventories existing programs and ideas, identifying relevant efforts from the past five years by New York State, New York City, and nonprofit and community groups. It is accompanied by a brief narrative that offers more context.</p><br>

      <p class="p-narrow">Beginning in the early 2000s under Mayor Michael Bloomberg and his Transportation Commissioner, Janette Sadik-Khan, New York City made a significant push to broaden the function and safety of its traffic arterials through measures such as dedicated bus and bike lanes, lower speed limits, intersection redesigns, and more street trees and green infrastructure. This has largely continued under subsequent administrations.</p>
      <p class="p-narrow">The Department of Transportation (DOT) is redesigning four arterials—Atlantic Avenue, Fourth Avenue, Grand Concourse, and Queens Boulevard—with major safety and aesthetic improvements under Great Streets, a capital program of Vision Zero. DOT also piloted and made permanent “busways” along 14th Street and Jamaica and Archer Avenues, permitting only buses, trucks, and emergency vehicles on a portion of these thoroughfares. The agency is piloting several other interventions that could also be applied to arterials, such as adaptive (“smart”) curb management on the Upper West Side, local delivery hubs (“microhubs”), street activity sensors, and “Cool Corridors,” a FEMA-funded project that involves developing a toolkit of heat mitigating interventions for different types of thoroughfares. And the recent Pedestrian Mobility Plan, which we examine in our <a href="https://mas-org.github.io/greener-corridors/built-for-auto/" target="_blank">Built for the Automobile post</a>, categorizes every street segment into one of five levels of pedestrian demand, a refreshing alternative to the more conventional vehicle-oriented street classification.</p>

      <p class="p-narrow">Several recent rezonings also have implications for arterials. Jerome Avenue, a thoroughfare in the Bronx characterized by many auto-related businesses, was rezoned under Mayor Bill de Blasio in a push to generate more affordable housing. This approach has continued under Mayor Eric Adams through proposed rezonings that cover parts of Atlantic Avenue and several corridors in Jamaica. Under the administration’s City of Yes initiatives, the City has loosened restrictions on the siting of EV infrastructure, bike parking, permeable paving, street trees, and rain gardens in most locations throughout the city. City of Yes also seeks to encourage more development around transportation hubs and to introduce corridor design rules to ensure that buildings better contribute to their surroundings and conflicts between auto repair shops and pedestrians are minimized.</p>
      <p class="p-narrow">Recent federal investments have brought more attention to arterials, including $29.75 million for more permanent improvements to Queens Boulevard and $150 million to improve pedestrian, cyclist, and bus movement alongside the Cross-Bronx Expressway. Countless City Council members, BIDs, nonprofits, community advocates, and others have studied and advocated for larger citywide changes to truck routes, the urban forest, parking mandates, green infrastructure, freight delivery, and other priorities.</p><br>
      <h1>A Ways to Go</h1>

      <h1>What's Next</h1>
      <p class="p-narrow">Reimagining arterial thoroughfares undoubtedly requires navigating a complexity of logistical, political, staffing, and budgetary constraints, but also the willingness to think more holistically and boldly about what these spaces can be. In the coming months, MAS will work with researchers and practitioners to understand how New York City’s arterials could function better, building off the meaningful investments that have already been made, in order to present a policy framework for greener, healthier, and more equitable corridors.</p>
